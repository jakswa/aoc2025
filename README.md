# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Approach

- **Code written manually** (no AI-assisted coding)
- File structure generated with AI
- AI used for code review and improvement suggestions after solving

## Usage

Run tests with example inputs:
```bash
cargo test              # all days
cargo test day01        # specific day
```

Run solutions with real inputs:
```bash
cargo run -- 1          # day 1, part 1
cargo run -- 1 2        # day 1, part 2
```

## Structure

- `src/dayXX.rs` - solution code with tests
- `input/dayXX_test.txt` - example inputs from problem descriptions
- `input/dayXX.txt` - real puzzle inputs
